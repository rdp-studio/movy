To create your own animation, you can start a new javascript file. Following is a simple hello-world program for movy.js.

```js
import * as mo from "movy";

const t = mo
  .addText("movy.js is simple!", {
    scale: 1,
    color: "yellow",
  })
  .reveal();

mo.run();
```

Save the file as `hello.js`, then open the animation in the browser by

```sh
movy hello.js
```
